    "# Understanding data spread\n",
    "# Standard deviation is a numerical measure of how spread out data points are around the mean. It's useful when variability is as important as the average. \n",

    "# Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value, which is 86.4.\n",
