## Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
## Tuple has curvy brackets 

## Ordered: When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

## Unchangeable: Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot replace, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

##Allow Duplicates: Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:


thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
print(type(thistuple))

## Here banana will not be replaced bt pear as it is a tuple
# thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# thistuple[1]="pear"
# print("After update: ",thistuple)
