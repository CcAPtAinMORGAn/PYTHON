##1. List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members

## Ordered: When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change. If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.
## Changeable: The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
## Allow Duplicates: Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value.


# mylist = ['apple','mango','banana']
# print(mylist)


# list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
# print(list1)
# print(type(list1))


# thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
#             #0        #1       #2
# print(thislist[1])
